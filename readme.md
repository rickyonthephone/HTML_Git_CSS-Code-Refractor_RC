# Refactor Client Code for Web Accessibility

## Project Scope

Refactor code to satisfy the accessibility critieria listed below in the Acceptance Criteria and keep code cleaner than what is provided. If needed look over code and make any improvements to the codebase for long-term sustainability using current HTML semantics and ensure the code flows with the layout of the webpage. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab on the right side of the repository's page.

4. From the settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `lernantino` and the project is `css-demo-site`, your URL would be `lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site`)

You can also refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) to walk through the steps needed to deploy.

**Important**: It may take a few moments for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project doesn't deploy or show up, make sure that all file paths in your application are relative and using the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, so there is a difference between a capitalized and uncapitalized letter to them.

Make sure you add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
